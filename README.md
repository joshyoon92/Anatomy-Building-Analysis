# Anatomy-Building-Analysis

Joshua Yoon


Architects, clients, and the contractors spend too much time analyzing a building manually. Taking dimensions to create volumes, cost from each material, and etc. 
What if a program is created where they only need to input a size of the building and all their questions are answered so that it can be used by all of the disciplines 
in creating a building? From this existing reality in architecture field, I have come up with a program called, “Anatomy: Building Analysis,” to expedite the early
design and pricing stage.

“Anatomy is the science that studies the structure of the human body”, and this program analyzes the building structure with only given dimensions. So what is this analysis?
The program evaluates many different aspects of the given building, that includes cost of the building, size of the concrete columns, number of the columns, slab thickness, 
how many floors, volume of building, and residential units per floor. Not only it allows users to input as many buildings they want in different sizes but is able to output 
all the analyzed information on to a text file to compare and contrast.

Why is it useful for clients and other disciplines to readily see all this information? Because in this field, for anyone to obtain this kind of information, one needs 
to go through architects, city officials, attorneys, structure engineers, and etc.  So much man power, time and money need to be spent to analyze a building. Instead of 
going through many layers of people, a simple program that I have created allows quick and easy analysis.  


General Instructions on running this program.

1.	Save both python files in a same folder.
2.	In IDLE or Spyder or other programs to open python file named “Anatomy - 2.”
3.	Run the program by pressing F5.
4.	Input building name and dimensions of building
a.	Example of an input:
i.	Input the name of building:  “Joshua’s residential tower 1”
ii.	Input the length: 200
iii.	Input the width: 75
iv.	Input the height: 170
v.	Input your budget(million): 20
5.	After these 5 inputs, one can continually input a building after another, until one is ready to see all the inputted buildings.
6.	When ready to see the analyzed buildings, enter twice to stop the input process.
7.	Find a newly created text file, named “Summary.txt,” in the same folder as the python file. 
8.	Open “Summary.txt” file.
9.	Output of a building or multiple buildings will be shown.
10.	To run again open the  “Anatomy - 2,” again and keep inputting new buildings.
